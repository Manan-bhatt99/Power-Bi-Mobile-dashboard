# Power-Bi-Mobile-dashboard
This is an end-end power bi project where we have created an interactive dashboard created after analyzing data from mobile phone market and drawn business insights.

Objective- To analyze the sales data from mobile phone market to identify top performing indivisuals in terms of brands, products and geographical locations and build an interactive dashboard to decrease the turn around time.
Methodology:-
 Step1: ETL and data cleaning - after importing the csv file into power query editor we performed ETL process to load the data into our power query editor for data cleaning and preperation. we checked for data types, null values, missing values etc and after preparing this data we uploaded it into power bi desktop for visualization.
 Step2: Data visualization and dashboard creation - after understanding the problem statement and carefully going through the raw data provided by the client we created multiple visulisations to represent our insights, various visuals have been used to showcase our analysis in context of diffterent data points. we have used various filters and interactions to drill down our data with specific requirements.
 Step3: DAX calculations - We have created multiple reports apart from the dashboard using DAX queries to show MTD(month to date) or YTD(year to date) analysis of our sales data along with same period last year comparisons of various entities for a detailed analysis.
 Step4: Navigations and Interactions: We have created Navigation buttons to swiftly navigate to various reports as per the requirement to save time and added interaction controls on various visuals to edit/remove interactions between the visuals and filters as per the user requirement
 Step5: Publishing Dasboard: Once our dashboard was finally prepared, we had publised it on Power bi services to share the dashboard with various stake holders and created security hierarchies.
